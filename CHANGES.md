# Changes in 0.4.0

## Breaking changes

-   From now on, a --mode flag has to be given as first parameter when
    mounting, with either --mode=cat or --mount=split

## Chronologically

-   Add ctrlc as dependency

-   Unmount automatically on SIGINT

-   Use i64 instead of JSON Strings
    
    Converting to JSON is inefficient and prevents proper database
    operations. Using i64 to store a u64 in the database is a way better
    approach. Via the From-trait I can transparently keep using the
    exisiting methods.

-   Use String conversion instead of JSON Strings
    
    Converting OsStrings to Strings is much more efficient than encoding
    them to JSON Strings. Also, JSON Strings in the database prevent proper
    usage of certain database operations, like searching for substrings.

-   Remove serde dependency
    
    Without the need to use JSON Strings, I can get rid of the serde
    dependency.

-   Move populate into SplitFS
    
    Since CatFS will use its own version of populate, it makes sense to put
    the methods to their respective struct implementations.

-   Use termination feature of ctrlc
    
    With this feature enabled, the unmounting will happen not only when a
    SIGINT is caught, but also on SIGTERM.

-   Change return type to Self
    
    This makes it easier to adjust the code for different implementations.

-   Add vdir parameter
    
    This parameter will denote if a directory is just a "virtual directory",
    actually referencing parts of a regular file.

-   Move identical code block to dedicated method

-   Remove offset field from FileHandle
    
    Seeking to a byte position is a neglectable operation, not worth the
    hassle of maintaining an offset field.

-   Implement CatFS
    
    CatFS is the reverse operation to SplitFS. It presents the file parts,
    as displayed by SplitFS as single files again and handles file access to
    the parts transparently.

-   Add mount flag to use CatFS or SplitFS
    
    When mounting a directory, the user now has to give a mode flag.
    
    If the want to use SplitFS, they will need:
    
        scfs --mode=split <base directory> <mount point>
    
    If they want to use CatFS:
    
        scfs --mode=cat <base directory> <mount point>

-   Use timestamp as filehandle key
    
    The previous implementation used the latest created key plus one. This
    leads to a race condition on parallel file access. By using the current
    timestamp in nanoseconds, it is nearly impossible to assign the same key
    to two separate filehandles.

-   Increase TTL to 24 hours
    
    Since the base directory will be mounted read-only and is expected to
    never change during mounting time (at least for now), it is quite
    senseless for such a small timeout like one second.
    
    By increasing it to 24 hours, the kernel might cache lookup and getattr
    results, hence avoiding expensive online checks.

# Changes in 0.3.0

First public release on crates.io. No other changes.

# Changes in 0.2.0

-   Do not include . and .. for now
    
    These two entries are not strictly necessary and at the moment it
    interferes with the offset calculation.

-   Use offset parameter in readdir
    
    If it is not used, directories with many files are not displayed
    correctly.

# Changes in 0.1.0

Initial release, first working prototype of SplitFS.
