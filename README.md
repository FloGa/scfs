# SCFS – SplitCatFS

A convenient splitting and concatenating filesystem.

## Motivation

### History

While setting up a cloud based backup and archive solution, I encountered the
following phenomenon: Many small files would get uploaded quite fast and –
depending on the actual cloud storage provider – highly concurrently, while
big files tend to slow down the whole process. The explanation is simple, many
cloud storage providers do not support concurrent or chunked uploads of a
single file, sometimes they would not even support resuming a partial upload.
You would need to upload it in one go, sequentially one byte at a time, it's
all or nothing.

Now consider a scenario, where you upload a huge file, like a mirror of your
Raspberry Pi's SD card with the system and configuration on it. I have such a
file, it is about 4 GB big. Now, while backing up my system, this was the last
file to be uploaded. According to ETA calculations, it would have taken
several hours, so I let it run overnight. The next morning I found out that
after around 95% of upload process, my internet connection vanished for just a
few seconds, but long enough for the transfer tool to abort the upload. The
temporary file got deleted from the cloud storage, so I had to start from zero
again. Several hours of uploading wasted.

I thought of a way to split big files, so that I can upload it more
efficiently, but I came to the conclusion, that manually splitting files,
uploading them, and deleting them afterwards locally, is not a very scalable
solution.

So I came up with the idea of a special filesystem. A filesystem that would
present big files as if they were many small chunks in separate files. In
reality, the chunks would all point to the same physical file, only with
different offsets. This way I could upload chunked files in parallel without
losing too much progress, even if the upload gets aborted midway.

*SplitFS* was born.

If I download such chunked file parts, I would need to call `cat * >file`
afterwards to re-create the actual file. This seems like a similar hassle like
manually splitting files. That's why I had also *CatFS* in mind, when
developing SCFS. CatFS will concatenate chunked files transparently and
present them as complete files again.

CatFS is included in SCFS since version 0.4.0.


### Why Rust?

I am relatively new to Rust and I thought, the best way to deepen my
understanding with Rust is to take on a project that would require dedication
and a certain knowledge of the language.

## Installation

SCFS can be installed easily through Cargo via `crates.io`:

``` text
cargo install scfs
```

## Usage

### SplitFS

To mount a directory with SplitFS, use the following form:

``` text
scfs --mode=split <base directory> <mount point>
```

The directory specified as `mount point` will now reflect the content of `base
directory`, replacing each regular file with a directory that contains
enumerated chunks of that file as separate files.

Since version 0.7.0, it is possible to use a custom block size for the file
fragments. For example, to use 1&nbsp;MB chunks instead of the default size of
2&nbsp;MB, you would go with:

``` text
scfs --mode=split --blocksize=1048576 <base directory> <mount point>
```

Where 1048576 is 1024 * 1024, so one megabyte in bytes.

### CatFS

To mount a directory with CatFS, use the following form:

``` text
scfs --mode=cat <base directory> <mount point>
```

Please note that `base directory` needs to be a directory structure that has
been generated by SplitFS. CatFS will refuse mounting the directory otherwise.

The directory specified as `mount point` will now reflect the content of `base
directory`, replacing each directory with chunked files in it as single files.

## Limitations

Please be aware that this project is merely a raw prototype for now!
Specifically:

-   It only works on Linux for now, maybe even on UNIX. But definitely not on
    Windows or MacOS.

-   It can only work with directories and regular files. Every other file type
    will be ignored or may end up in a `panic!`.

-   The base directory will be mounted read-only in the new mount point, and
    SCFS expects that the base directory will not be altered while mounted.
