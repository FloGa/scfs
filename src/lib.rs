//! # SCFS – SplitCatFS
//!
//! A convenient splitting and concatenating filesystem.
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! ### History
//!
//! While setting up a cloud based backup and archive solution, I encountered the
//! following phenomenon: Many small files would get uploaded quite fast and –
//! depending on the actual cloud storage provider – highly concurrently, while
//! big files tend to slow down the whole process. The explanation is simple, many
//! cloud storage providers do not support concurrent or chunked uploads of a
//! single file, sometimes they would not even support resuming a partial upload.
//! You would need to upload it in one go, sequentially one byte at a time, it's
//! all or nothing.
//!
//! Now consider a scenario, where you upload a huge file, like a mirror of your
//! Raspberry Pi's SD card with the system and configuration on it. I have such a
//! file, it is about 4 GB big. Now, while backing up my system, this was the last
//! file to be uploaded. According to ETA calculations, it would have taken
//! several hours, so I let it run overnight. The next morning I found out that
//! after around 95% of upload process, my internet connection vanished for just a
//! few seconds, but long enough for the transfer tool to abort the upload. The
//! temporary file got deleted from the cloud storage, so I had to start from zero
//! again. Several hours of uploading wasted.
//!
//! I thought of a way to split big files, so that I can upload it more
//! efficiently, but I came to the conclusion, that manually splitting files,
//! uploading them, and deleting them afterwards locally, is not a very scalable
//! solution.
//!
//! So I came up with the idea of a special filesystem. A filesystem that would
//! present big files as if they were many small chunks in separate files. In
//! reality, the chunks would all point to the same physical file, only with
//! different offsets. This way I could upload chunked files in parallel without
//! losing too much progress, even if the upload gets aborted midway.
//!
//! *SplitFS* was born.
//!
//! If I download such chunked file parts, I would need to call `cat * >file`
//! afterwards to re-create the actual file. This seems like a similar hassle like
//! manually splitting files. That's why I had also *CatFS* in mind, when
//! developing SCFS. CatFS will concatenate chunked files transparently and
//! present them as complete files again.
//!
//! CatFS is included in SCFS since version 0.4.0.
//!
//!
//! ### Why Rust?
//!
//! I am relatively new to Rust and I thought, the best way to deepen my
//! understanding with Rust is to take on a project that would require dedication
//! and a certain knowledge of the language.
//!
//! ## Installation
//!
//! SCFS can be installed easily through Cargo via `crates.io`:
//!
//! ``` text
//! cargo install scfs
//! ```
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ### SplitFS
//!
//! To mount a directory with SplitFS, use the following form:
//!
//! ``` text
//! scfs --mode=split <base directory> <mount point>
//! ```
//!
//! Since version 0.8.0 this can be simplified by using the dedicated `splitfs`
//! binary:
//!
//! ``` text
//! splitfs <base directory> <mount point>
//! ```
//!
//! The directory specified as `mount point` will now reflect the content of `base
//! directory`, replacing each regular file with a directory that contains
//! enumerated chunks of that file as separate files.
//!
//! Since version 0.7.0, it is possible to use a custom block size for the file
//! fragments. For example, to use 1&nbsp;MB chunks instead of the default size of
//! 2&nbsp;MB, you would go with:
//!
//! ``` text
//! splitfs --blocksize=1048576 <base directory> <mount point>
//! ```
//!
//! Where 1048576 is 1024 * 1024, so one megabyte in bytes.
//!
//! You can even leverage the calculating power of your Shell, like for example in
//! Bash:
//!
//! ``` text
//! splitfs --blocksize=$((1024 * 1024)) <base directory> <mount point>
//! ```
//!
//! You can actually go as far as to set a block size of one byte, but be prepared
//! for a ridiculous amount of overhead or maybe even a system freeze because the
//! metadata table grows too large.
//!
//! ### CatFS
//!
//! To mount a directory with CatFS, use the following form:
//!
//! ``` text
//! scfs --mode=cat <base directory> <mount point>
//! ```
//!
//! Since version 0.8.0 this can be simplified by using the dedicated `catfs`
//! binary:
//!
//! ``` text
//! catfs <base directory> <mount point>
//! ```
//!
//! Please note that `base directory` needs to be a directory structure that has
//! been generated by SplitFS. CatFS will refuse mounting the directory otherwise.
//!
//! The directory specified as `mount point` will now reflect the content of `base
//! directory`, replacing each directory with chunked files in it as single files.
//!
//! ### Additional FUSE mount options
//!
//! Since v0.8.0 it is possible to pass additional mount options to the underlying
//! FUSE library.
//!
//! SCFS supports two ways of specifying options, either via the "-o" option, or
//! via additional arguments after a "--" separator. This is in accordance to
//! other FUSE based filesystems like EncFS.
//!
//! These two calls are equivalent:
//!
//! ``` text
//! scfs --mode=split -o nonempty mirror mountpoint
//! scfs --mode=split mirror mountpoint -- nonempty
//! ```
//!
//! Of course, these methods also work in the `splitfs` and `catfs` binaries.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! I consider this project no longer a "raw prototype" and I am dog-fooding it,
//! meaning I use it in my own backup strategies and create features based on my
//! personal needs.
//!
//! However, this might not meet the needs of the typical user and without
//! feedback I might not even think of some scenarios to begin with.
//!
//! Specifically, these are the current limitations of SCFS:
//!
//! -   It should work an all UNIX based systems, like Linux and maybe some MacOS
//!     versions, however without MacOS specific file attributes. But definitely
//!     not on Windows, since this would need special handling of system calls,
//!     which I haven't had time to care of yet.
//!
//! -   It can only work with directories, regular files, and symlinks (since
//!     v0.8.0). Every other file types (device files, pipes, and so on) will be
//!     silently ignored. Since v0.8.0: Not supported file types will no longer
//!     result in a panic.
//!
//! -   The base directory will be mounted read-only in the new mount point, and
//!     SCFS expects that the base directory will not be altered while mounted.
